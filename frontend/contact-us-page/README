# Contact Us Page Frontend

This project contains the frontend of the Contact Us application. The frontend is primarily implemented using React and is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

## Overview

The Contact Us frontend application is designed to provide users with a simple and intuitive interface for submitting inquiries and feedback. It features two main components: the `ContactInfoPage` and the `ThankYouPage`.

## Main Components

### 1. ContactInfoPage

The `ContactInfoPage` is the primary interface where users can fill out a form to contact the organization. This page includes fields for the user's name, email, phone number, and message. The form submission triggers a POST request to the backend API, which processes the data.

- **Features**:
  - Displays contact information for the organization, such as phone number, email, and business hours.
  - Provides a user-friendly form for submitting inquiries.
  - Includes validation to ensure that all required fields are completed before submission.

- **Key Files**:
  - `src/pages/ContactInfoPage.js`: The main React component that renders the contact form and handles user input.
  - `src/pages/ContactInfoPage.css`: The stylesheet for styling the `ContactInfoPage`.

### 2. ThankYouPage

The `ThankYouPage` is displayed after the user successfully submits the contact form. It provides a confirmation that the form has been submitted and thanks the user for their inquiry.

- **Features**:
  - Displays a thank-you message to the user.
  - Informs the user that their message has been received and will be responded to shortly.

- **Key Files**:
